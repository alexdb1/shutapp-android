Are you tired of seeing your muted WhatsApp chats at the top of the chat list with unread messages, even though you have no intention of reading them at the moment?

ShutApp is an Android app for **rooted devices** that will automatically mark your muted chats as read and prevent them from jumping to the top of the chat list.

## Usage

1. Download the [APK](app/app-release.apk) to your computer
2. Install it by running `adb install app-release.apk`
3. Open the application on your device
4. Grant root access to ShutApp when requested
5. Grant notificaiton access to ShutApp when requested
6. Configure all of your muted groups to display notifications when muted -- this is what invokes ShutApp to run and mark them as read
7. Enjoy!
